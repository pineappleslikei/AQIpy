AQIpy is a command line application to quicky lookup the Air Quality Index for a given zip code.

To get started you'll need to:
1) generate a token at https://docs.airnowapi.org/
2) copy and paste your token into the credentials module
3) remove "example" from your credentials module file name
4) edit the startup message in the aqipy module to suit your needs :)
